# WeatherPy

---Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Request an API keys from OpenWeatherMap.org.Import the api keys froem weather api keys.You can make an API call by city ID.Here you can select the url by city id.Then need to install pip install citypy . 
---Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: Latitude vs. Temperature,Latitude vs. Humidity,Latitude vs. Cloudiness,Latitude vs. Wind Speed.
---Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship:Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere.
---Create the following plots:Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude,Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude,Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude,Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude,Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude,Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude,Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude,Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude.
